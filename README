Quick guide to launch the prototype

1) Run ElasticSearch

>cd etc/tools/elasticsearch-1.3.1/bin
>./myelastic.sh

or

>./elasticsearch -Des.index.store.type=memory -d

Create a simple ElasticSearch Store without persistence
The metadata records needs to be indexed

Define a new mapping for the products to avoid index with an analyzer the content of the hierarchyNames (topic categories) to be used to create the facets

new_index_mapping.sh

2) Index metadata records

Run org.elastic.ISO2JSON

In Eclipse working dir is the top project directory

This Class extracts info from XML records with XPath and create a json object stored in a file for each record. Then all the JSON files are indexed in the ElasticSearch.

A typical JSON record is described here https://gist.github.com/gaubert/e26eb189f7e42317fbb1

3) Run Web App search

The Web App is based a on a tiny web framework called Spark meant for rapid development (like Sinatra and other).

It is based on http://www.sparkjava.com

Web pages are built using a simple Template engine called Freemarker (http://freemarker.org).
It is also based on Boostrap and Jquery and a bit of javascript.

Elastic Search is accessed using the REST interface with a REST client.

Run org.elastic.web.SparkSearchWeb 

Point your browser to:
http://localhost:4567/

Search is based on having different weight for the different parts of the record (Title, Abstract).
Use Facetted search to filter out results.
Highlight found keywords in search results.
Bookmarkable search.

4) Elastic Search Experiment

In elastic-experiment/etc there are also multiple curl requests to experiment with ElasticSearch
